        "The typical {@item shifter's shine|GriffonsSaddlebag2}, a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes your face to appear more glamorous. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, your skin's complexion clears, appears healthier, and grows more taut. Your face, while largely unchanged, is distinctly more attractive and exudes a weak aura of enchantment magic. When you make a Charisma check while under the effects of this potion, you can choose to forgo rolling the {@dice d20} to get a 10 on the die. Once you use this property, you can't use it again for the remainder of the potion's duration. The potion is a rich honey color and swirls lazily around, regardless of how it's handled. It can be found in any sort of vessel, though it is usually found in glass jars. The eye of a shapeshifter drifts along the potion's bottom, making it a daunting beverage for the average taverngoer to order. It has an extremely strong alcoholic taste with a hint of caramel. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage."

        "A whispergust mote is a sentient breath of air typically separated from a larger air elemental. When not {@condition invisible}, its form resembles a dollop of blue whipped cream but is weightless and fluid to the touch. The mote can use an action to become {@condition invisible}, but it typically only does so when it senses danger. When left to its own devices, the mote will gently tousle the hair of passing creatures or flip a fallen leaf. While it is a form that is defined by its wanderlust, it nevertheless enjoys the company and experiences of adventuring parties that travel to new and unique locations. Most owners of a whispergust mote are rarely so bold as to claim ownership of it at all.",
        "The mote is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover. It has AC 10, 5 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The whispergust mote regains all its hit points if affected by a {@spell gust of wind} spell or similar magic.",

You can seal or unseal a bottle, flask, jar, waterskin, or similar container with the stopper as an action. When you do, the stopper magically resizes to fit the container's opening (up to 6 inches in diameter). While a container is stoppered in this way, any nonliving liquid inside it doesn't age, decay, rot, or spoil. If the container has a tap or similar means of dispensing the liquid without unstoppering it (such as a keg), the effect on the liquid ends once it leaves the vessel."

A tiny, single light from the dancing lights spell is often cast within the drink when served. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage."
