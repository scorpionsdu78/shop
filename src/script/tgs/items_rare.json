While wearing the armor, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to magically unfurl the mechanical wings and fly up to 60 feet in a straight line toward a point of bright light that you can see (such as a torch, light spell, or the sun) without provoking opportunity attacks. The wings remain unfurled until you touch the ground, during which time you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round and gain a flying speed of 30 feet, which you can use to glide horizontally as you descend. While gliding in this way, you cannot fly upwards unless you use the armor to fly toward a point of bright light again. When you land on the ground while falling in this way, the mechanical wings refold themselves to your back, and you take no damage from falling."

While holding the trident, you can use a bonus action to make a blood offering. When you do, choose a number of hit points to sacrifice. You take necrotic damage equal to the amount you sacrifice, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. For every 5 hit points you sacrifice, the trident creates 1 shard of magic obsidian, which floats alongside the trident's three prongs for 1 minute. You can have up to 3 shards in this way at a time. The trident deals an extra {@damage 1d4} piercing damage to any target it hits for each floating shard it has.",
        "When you throw the trident while it has at least 1 floating shard, the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack."

A creature that attempts to remove an object locked in this way must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of the cart for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature is unwilling to move toward the cart or interact with it for the duration. If the cart is a rare or very rare version, the creature also takes psychic damage on a failed saving throw. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. You can speak the second command word as an action again to unlock any number of objects within the cart.",

If the stump is destroyed, the dwelling collapses and magically shunts anything inside it (other than the furniture) to the nearest unoccupied space next to where the root was buried.

When you roll initiative while wearing the bracers, they begin to billow out wafting clouds around your wrists. The clouds surrounding your wrists grow darker with every charge the bracers have, becoming fierce storm clouds when fully charged. The bracers can hold up to 5 charges, which are lost after 1 minute. The bracers gain 1 charge after you hit a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack while wearing them. If the bracers have 5 charges when you hit a creature in this way, they unleash a burst of electricity and lose all their stored charges, dealing {@damage 1d8} lightning damage to the target of the attack and up to 2 other creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you.",
        "In addition, while wearing the bracers, you can use your reaction when you take lightning damage to reduce that damage by {@dice 1d8 + 4} and cause the bracers to gain 1 charge."

When you take the {@action Attack} action using this axe, you can forgo one of your attacks to swing the axe in front of you and speak its command word. When you do, the axe emits a crashing wave of magical water. The wave is 10 feet tall and extends from you in a 30-foot cone, after which it spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in the area within 30 feet of it before the water vanishes. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 4d8} bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}. This property can't be used again until the next dawn."

        "This spinning metal sphere is 6 inches in diameter and weighs 5 pounds. You can tap the orb twice as an action to activate it. While activated, the orb records basic details about the space that it can see within 100 feet. The orb has {@sense darkvision} out to 100 feet, but can't see through heavily obscured areas or illusions. Tapping it twice again deactivates the orb.",
        "The activated orb can display its recorded maps. If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak its first command word, followed by a description of a location it's mapped. For example, you can command the orb to recall the entrance to a series of catacombs you explored 2 days ago, or the path you took to get through a twisting labyrinth. When you do, an illusory map appears in a 5-foot sphere centered on the orb that shows basic details about the recorded area, such as buildings, pathways, roads, signs, topography, and trees. While you're within 5 feet of the map, you can use a series of intuitive gestures to change the map's rotation, displayed location, or scale: showing as little of the recorded area as a 25-foot radius, or as much as a 1-mile radius. Speaking the command word again causes the map to vanish.",
        "If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak a second command word as an action to make the orb rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The orb hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 30 feet from the hovering orb, it follows you until it is within 30 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the orb sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive.",
        "You can speak a third command word as an action, followed by a location name, while within 30 feet of the floating orb to cause it to move on its own. If the named location has been recorded by the orb and is within 1 mile of you, the sphere moves on its own and floats up to 10 feet ahead of you, guiding you to the named location using any of its recorded maps of the area to guide you. Once you reach your destination or speak the command word again, the orb begins to follow you again."
