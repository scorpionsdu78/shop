The creature regains 10 hit points for each charge you spend and is cured of either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition paralyzed}, or {@condition poisoned}. If a creature regains hit points in this way that would take it above its hit point maximum, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to the number of restored hit points above its hit point maximum."
