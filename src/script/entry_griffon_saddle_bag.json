        "Wrought from metal in the likeness of a brazier, this ranged weapon's grip has been covered in wax and has a simple candle positioned in front of where the arrow or bolt is fired from. The candle is magic and never runs out of wax, nor can it be removed from the weapon. You can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word to cause the candle to light itself, shedding light like a normal candle while ablaze. While the candle is lit, this magic weapon deals an extra 2 fire damage to any target it hits with a ranged attack. The candle's flame lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.",
        "If you roll the same number on both {@dice d20}s when you make a ranged attack roll with advantage or disadvantage using this weapon while its candle is lit, the ammunition becomes wreathed in a conflagration of uncontrollable flames. The arrow or bolt flies toward the target and explodes, destroying the ammunition and dealing {@damage 4d6} fire damage to the target (instead of the attack's normal damage), or half as much damage if the total of the attack roll was less than the target's AC. This fire ignites flammable objects within 5 feet of the target that aren't being worn or carried. This property can't be used again until the next dawn."

The copy appears after 10 minutes, sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and remains for the duration of the rest or until the glasses are moved or you move more than 30 feet away from them. It can perform light activity within the glasses' space, such as reading, writing, or copying spells into your spellbook, provided it has all the materials necessary to do so. You decide what the copy does at the start of the long rest. The copy can't speak, hear, or see anything outside of its space.

      "This flashy set of pants has four pockets that each lead to a special, extradimensional space. Each pocket is six inches wide at the mouth and can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The pants always weigh 1 pound, regardless of their contents.",
      "Placing an object in one of the pants' pockets follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the pants requires an action as your hand rummages around inside for a few moments before finding the item it's looking for.",
      "If the pants are overloaded, pierced, or torn, they rupture and tear, scattering their contents in a 300-foot radius around you. Casting the {@spell mending} spell on the pants daily for 30 days restores the pants' connection to the extradimensional spaces. If one or more pockets are turned inside out, their contents spill forth, unharmed, but the pocket must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the pocket can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.",
      "Placing the pants inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened."

A target hit with the acid-coated arrow takes an extra {@damage 1d4} acid damage. Hit or miss, a nonmagical coated arrow is destroyed after the attack.",

When you take the {@action Attack} action using this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to replace one of your weapon attacks with a special attack. This special attack duplicates the effect of the {@spell Melf's acid arrow} spell and uses the same attack bonus as your normal weapon attacks with the bow."

      "This spinning metal sphere is 6 inches in diameter and weighs 5 pounds. You can tap the orb twice as an action to activate it. While activated, the orb records basic details about the space that it can see within 100 feet. The orb has {@sense darkvision} out to 100 feet, but can't see through heavily obscured areas or illusions. Tapping it twice again deactivates the orb.",
      "The activated orb can display its recorded maps. If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak its first command word, followed by a description of a location it's mapped. For example, you can command the orb to recall the entrance to a series of catacombs you explored 2 days ago, or the path you took to get through a twisting labyrinth. When you do, an illusory map appears in a 5-foot sphere centered on the orb that shows basic details about the recorded area, such as buildings, pathways, roads, signs, topography, and trees. While you're within 5 feet of the map, you can use a series of intuitive gestures to change the map's rotation, displayed location, or scale: showing as little of the recorded area as a 25-foot radius, or as much as a 1-mile radius. Speaking the command word again causes the map to vanish.",
      "If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak a second command word as an action to make the orb rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The orb hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 30 feet from the hovering orb, it follows you until it is within 30 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the orb sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive.",
      "You can speak a third command word as an action, followed by a location name, while within 30 feet of the floating orb to cause it to move on its own. If the named location has been recorded by the orb and is within 1 mile of you, the sphere moves on its own and floats up to 10 feet ahead of you, guiding you to the named location using any of its recorded maps of the area to guide you. Once you reach your destination or speak the command word again, the orb begins to follow you again."

      "This magical key is one of several made by a secret order of historians and archivists. While holding the key, you can use an action to twist the key, as if you were unlocking a door. When you do, a magical, spectral door slowly appears in front of you over the course of 1 minute, duplicating the effect of the {@spell Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion|PHB|magnificent mansion} spell with the following change. The dwelling always includes a large library that magically includes copies of books, scrolls, maps, and more. The library does not count toward the total amount of space created by the spell. Its contents are strangely organized and seemingly change each time the key is used. A creature can visit the library and attempt to uncover a piece of knowledge, such as ancient poetry, the history of a forgotten kingdom, or the family lineage of a tyrannical king. The GM determines the checks and DCs needed to locate a given piece of information. For example, a book of foreign nursery rhymes may be easy to find, but a copy of necromantic research documents would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.",

When you drink this beverage, it fills you with a rejuvenating and magical vigor that builds over the course of 1 minute. At the end of this minute, you can choose to recover one expended spell slot by spending a number of Hit Dice equal to the spell slot's level, up to a maximum of 5. Once the mug has created this beverage, it can't create it again until the next dawn."

You know the type of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. This property doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."

      "This Large, dark iron chariot weighs 300 pounds and can fit up to four Medium or smaller creatures. While you're in the chariot, you have resistance to fire damage. Two sets of floating, flaming reins appear when you stand in the chariot, which are harmless to you. As an action, you can crack the reins downward to summon two armored {@creature nightmare|MM|nightmares} that are hitched to the front of the chariot. The nightmares have a +1 bonus to AC and exist until they drop to 0 hit points. You can use an action to dismiss them, which works only if you are standing on the chariot. The nightmares are friendly to you, fight only to protect themselves, and can't be unhitched from the chariot. The nightmares' hitches prevent them from being ridden.",
